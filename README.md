This is a stripped down version of [shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake](https://github.com/shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake).

Leave me alone.

This is only tested on Alpine run on WSL version 2.

Basic build deps: 
`apk add autoconf cmake diffutils gcc gettext-dev git gmp-dev meson mpc1-dev mpfr-dev nasm ninja po4a py3-mako yasm`
