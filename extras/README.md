Get ANGLE's DLL in zip package from http://chromium.woolyss.com/download/

Require:
libEGL.dll
libGLESv2.dll
D3DCompiler_47.dll

Use can software like loadscout to download only the 3 libs from the zip package. After that copy & paste the libs to each arch (angle_lib*).

But here is the necessary dll from the zip package anyway.
